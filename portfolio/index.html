            <h1> ABOUT ME </h1>
            <p> I am a motivated IT and software student seeking a work placement in software engineering. I have a Strong coding background with hands-on experience across Linux and Windows environments, problem-solving, and rapid learning of new technologies.</p>
            
            <h1> EXPERIENCE </h1>
            <h2> [REDACTED] — IT Support Technician/Engineer - APRIL 2024 </h2>
            <p>I worked for two weeks within a primary school’s trust consisting of three schools. Working for the MSP (Managed Service Provider) who supports the trust.
                Under supervision of the <strong>IT Manager</strong>, I was providing support to teachers and staff as well as experiencing a <strong>real work networked environment</strong>.
                On Monday, I learnt how the star topology increases network resilience. I also learnt the importance of groups in <strong>Active Directory</strong>. 
                I had to find a solution for a <strong>Year 3 EAL, sight impaired student</strong> to be able to cast the display of the Interactive White Board to an iPad 
                so he can use the built in accessibility to be able to see what's on the White Board clearly. To solve this I started to look at various <strong>VNC</strong> 
                options and seeing if any of them had all of the features that were needed. On Tuesday I learnt how to set up Splashtop Classroom and how to 
                use Apple's <strong>accessibility</strong> features. I also started to set up a school phone system, VOIP. It needed new firewall rules so we made a request to 
                <strong>LGFL</strong> to  make the firewall changes. I found a solution for the Year 3 student, which was Splashtop classroom. On Wednesday I set up a Laptop for 
                a teacher on the school’s network domain. I tested all the features that they would need such as Printing, network drives and VPN. I fixed the 
                temporary site manager's iPad that wasn’t printing by factory resetting and setting it up on the school's new iPad Management System called Meraki. 
                I helped a teacher by teaching her how to disable comment printing and displaying in Microsoft Word. And at a different school we started setting up 
                30 iPads to migrate them from <strong>Lightspeed</strong> to <strong>Meraki</strong>. I learned how to use Apple Device Enrolment to set up many iPads onto a school network, which 
                allows you to easily set up many iPads. On Thursday I set up Scan to OneDrive and Scan to Email on all the school's printers. And finally on Friday 
                we finished setting up 30 iPads and I did a demonstration to the teacher of the Year 3 Student on how to use <strong>Splashtop Classroom</strong> to stream the Interactive
                Whiteboard’s display to an iPad.</p>
