        <h2> Homeserver </h2>
        <p>All my services I host run on a 2011 Mac mini server that I have situated on my desk. Alongside the occasional Thinkpad that I hookup to my "loop" These all run on <a href="https://www.debian.org/"> Debian</a> as it is very stable.</p>
        <p>The webserver I use is <a href="https://apache.org/">Apache2</a>, this is mainly due to me not being able to get <a href="https://nginx.org/en/">nginx</a> working...</p>

        <h2> Desktop </h2>
        <p>My PC is a self-built desktop that contains an RTX 3050, Intel i5 13500, and 32GB of DDR4 RAM. It currently runs Gentoo GNU/Linux on it. </p>

        <h2> Laptop </h2>
        <p>My laptop of choice is a thinkpad x230, running <a href="https://github.com/merge/skulls">Coreboot Skulls</a> as my firmware of choice and <a href="https://trisquel.info/"> Trisquel GNU/Linux-libre</a> as my operating system. I choose both of these as they respect my freedom </p>

        <h2> Software </h2>
        <p>On my personal systems, for my window manager I run <a href="https://dwm.suckless.org/">dwm</a> with st and dmenu (I occasionally switch to rofi every now and then) my configurations for such can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/jraffstar/suckless">github</a>. For my browser I use <a href="https://icecatbrowser.org/index.html">GNU Icecat</a> with a few extra extensions. I use <a href="https://vscodium.com/">VSCodium</a> and vim as code editors. </p>
